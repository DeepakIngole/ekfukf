\begin{abstract}

  In this paper we present a documentation for an optimal filtering
  toolbox for the mathematical software package Matlab. 
  The toolbox features many filtering methods for discrete-time 
  state space models, including the well-known linear Kalman filter 
  and several non-linear extensions to it. 
  These non-linear methods are the extended Kalman filter, 
  the unscented Kalman filter, the Gauss-Hermite Kalman filter and 
  the third-order symmetric cubature Kalman filter. Algorithms for
  multiple model systems are provided in the form of an Interacting
  Multiple Model (IMM) filter and it's non-linear extensions, which
  are based on banks of extended and unscented Kalman filters. Also
  included in the toolbox are the Rauch-Tung-Striebel and two-filter
  smoother counter-parts for the filters, which can be used to smooth
  the previous state estimates, after obtaining new measurements. The
  usage and function of each method is illustrated with eight
  demonstration problems.

\section*{Preface}

Most of the software provided with this toolbox were originally created
by Simo S채rkk채 while he was doing research on his doctoral thesis
\citep{Sarkka:2006} in the Laboratory of Computational Engineering (LCE)
at Helsinki University of Technology (HUT). This document has been
written by Jouni Hartikainen at LCE during spring 2007 with a little
help from Simo S채rkk채. Jouni also checked and commented the software
code thoroughly. Many (small) bugs were fixed, and also some new
functions were implemented (for example 2nd order EKF and augmented
form UKF). Jouni also provided the software code for first three
demonstrations, modified the two last ones a bit, and ran all the
simulations. In 2010, Arno Solin added the cubature integration based 
methods to the toolbox.

First author would like to thank Doc. Aki Vehtari for helpful comments
during the work and for coming up with the idea of this toolbox in the
first place. Prof. Jouko Lampinen also deserves thanks for ultimately
making this work possible.
