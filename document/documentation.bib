                parametric distribution, one can define an online
                algorithm by a repetition of two steps: An update
                of the approximate posterior, when a new example
                arrives, and an optimal projection into the
                parametric family. Choosing this family to be

                asymptotic efficiency. An application to learning

                the best predictive ability among a class of linear
                models. The popular leave-one-out cross-validation
                method, which is asymptotically equivalent to many
                other model selection methods such as the Akaike
                information criterion (AIC), the $C_p$, and the
                bootstrap, is asymptotically inconsistent in the
                sense that the probability of selecting the model
                with the best predictive ability does not converge
                to 1 as the total number of observations $n
                \rightarrow \infty$. We show that the inconsistency
                of the leave-one-out cross-validation can be
                rectified by using a leave-$n_\nu$-out
                cross-validation with $n_\nu$, the number of
                observations reserved for validation, satisfying
                $n_\nu/n \rightarrow 1$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
                This is a somewhat shocking discovery, because
                $n_\nu/n \rightarrow 1$ is totally opposite to the
                popular leave-one-out recipe in cross-validation.
                Motivations, justifications, and discussions of
                some practical aspects of the use of the
                leave-$n_\nu$-out cross-validation method are
                provided, and results from a simulation study are

                difficult because a simple prior over weights
                implies a complex prior distribution over
                functions. In this paper we investigate the use of
                Gaussian process priors over functions, which
                permit the predictive Bayesian analysis for fixed
                values of hyperparameters to be carried out exactly
                using matrix operations. Two methods, using
                optimization and averaging (via Hybrid Monte Carlo)
                over hyperparameters have been tested on a number
                of challenging problems and have produced excellent
                results.},
